Designed and executed an unsupervised learning model to explore Facebook post metrics, including interactions, likes, shares, and posting times to identify engagement patterns. Conducted extensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), applied feature selection through correlation analysis and a heatmap. Implemented KMeans clustering with the elbow method for optimal cluster determination. Enhanced the model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and addressed outliers, achieving a silhouette score of 0.6025. This project uncovers meaningful patterns in post engagement and clustering performance.
